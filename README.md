## Pandas-EDA-Case-Study

This will become the README documenting your results. At the end of this case study, you will write a case study report and put it in **THIS** readme markdown file. For details of the deliverables, check the deliverable part of the [case study description](case_study_description.md).

If you haven't written a Markdown file (the README.md) before, here's a [guide](https://www.makeareadme.com/). Or you can browse the source code of the following professional presentations in markdown format from former Galvanize students. Note that these reports are for capstone projects, not case study. Your report for today will only contain contents up to exploratory data analysis. Focus on learning their layout and professionalism.
