# Identify Where the Most Track is Laid
## Pandas-EDA-Case-Study

## Features
The original dataset includes seven csv files *cities*, *lines*, *station_lines*, *stations*, *systems*, *track_lines*, *tracks* which share the key city_id

## Features of Interest
The columns best suited to answer our question are:
- City ID/Name: The cities 
- Country
- Track Length: The number of kilometers of track per city.

### City
### Number of Tracks?
### Track Length in km/mi?
### Year Built
This will become the README documenting your results.  

A description of the case study can be found [here.](case_study_description.md)
#### Deliverable  
This afternoon your group will present your results to the class from the README in your Github repository.  Your README markdown file should:  
  * Clearly state the goal of your project (what were you exploring?)
  * Describe the data.
    * What features (columns) did you have to work with?
    * What features were you interested in?  
    * Were the features numerical/categorical/text?
    * Was a lot of data missing?  If so, what did you do to handle it?
    * How did features relate to each other, and the values that you were interested in?  
    * Pictures are worth 1000s of words!
